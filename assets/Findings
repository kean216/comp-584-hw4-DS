Pros: Using a high-contrast background image. with light text. 
makes sure that users with low vision can still read the security alerts clearly.

Cons: While the table layout is 600px wide, if a user zooms in to 400% , 
the fixed width might cause horizontal scrolling, which is a 
'con' for user experience.
